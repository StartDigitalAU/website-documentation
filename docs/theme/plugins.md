# WordPress Plugins

At Start Digital, we rely on a carefully selected set of WordPress plugins to enhance functionality, improve workflow, and deliver high-quality websites to our clients. Here's an overview of our core plugin stack:

## Content Management

### Advanced Custom Fields Pro (ACF Pro)

ACF Pro is the backbone of our custom content management solutions. This premium plugin allows us to create flexible content fields, page builders, and custom post types with intuitive interfaces for our clients.

### ACF Extended

This powerful extension to ACF Pro adds even more functionality to our custom fields, including enhanced field types, admin interfaces, and developer tools that streamline our workflow.

### Classic Editor

We maintain the Classic Editor for certain projects where the block editor isn't required, providing a familiar editing experience for clients who prefer the traditional WordPress interface.

## Forms and Communication

### Gravity Forms

Our preferred form solution, Gravity Forms provides advanced form building capabilities with conditional logic, file uploads, and integrations with various third-party services.

### Gravity SMTP

This companion plugin to Gravity Forms ensures reliable email delivery by configuring proper SMTP settings, preventing form submissions from ending up in spam folders.

## SEO and Performance

### Yoast SEO

The industry standard for WordPress SEO, Yoast helps us optimize content, generate sitemaps, and manage technical SEO aspects to improve search engine visibility.

### Smush

Image optimization is crucial for site performance. Smush automatically compresses and optimizes images upon upload, reducing file sizes without compromising quality.

## Editor Enhancements

### TinyMCE Advanced

This plugin extends the classic WordPress editor with additional formatting options, giving content creators more control over text styling and layout.

## Development and Migration

### WP Migrate

Essential for our development workflow, WP Migrate (formerly WP Migrate DB Pro) allows us to easily move databases between environments, making the development-to-production pipeline smooth and efficient.

These plugins form the foundation of our WordPress development stack, enabling us to build robust, maintainable, and user-friendly websites for our clients.
